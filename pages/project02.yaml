    ## Overview

    For this project, you are to work in groups of **2 - 4** students to
    research an engineering ethics topic and then create a **video**
    presentation that accomplishes the following:

    1. Provide a brief background about the engineering topic or issue.

    2. Identify the stakeholders and outline the various viewpoints around the
    topic or issue.

    3. Analyze and discuss your own position and thoughts regarding the topic
    or issue.

    The goal of this project is for you to **research** a topic, **explain**
    the facts regarding the topic, **describe** the different stakeholders and
    viewpoints, and then **provide** your own analysis and evaluation of the
    ethics involved in the topic or issue.

    This **video** presentation should be around **5** minutes in length.  It
    will be played in class during the last week and you will have to answer
    some followup questions from the audience.
