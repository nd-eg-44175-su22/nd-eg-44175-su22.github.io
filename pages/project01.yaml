    ## Overview

    For this project, you are to work in groups of **2 - 3** students to
    analyze a movie through the lens of a professional engineering society code
    of ethics.

    ### Code of Ethics
    
    The first step is to read through one of the code of ethics directly
    related to your field of study:

    1. [ASME Code of Ethics](https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Get%20Involved/Advocacy/Policy-Publications/P-15-7-Ethics.pdf)

    2. [AIChE Code of Ethics](https://www.aiche.org/about/code-ethics)

    3. [ASCE Code of Ethics](https://www.asce.org/career-growth/ethics/code-of-ethics)

    4. [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct)
    
    5. [IEEE Code of Ethics](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html)

    ### Movie

    - [I am Jane Doe](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6398054/)

    Alternatively, you may watch one of the following movies if you wish to
    further explore the issue of diversity in STEM:

    - [Hidden Figures](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/)
    - [Underwater Dreams](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3563782/)
    - [CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4335520/)

    You may watch another movie not on this list if it is related to STEM and
    have it cleared with the instructor.  To watch a movie, you will need to
    use [Netflix][], [Amazon Video][], [Hulu][], [Google Play][], or the 
    [Apple Store][].

    [Netflix]: https://www.netflix.com/
    [Amazon Video]: https://www.amazon.com
    [Hulu]: https://www.hulu.com
    [Google Play]: https://play.google.com/store/movies?hl=en_US
    [Apple Store]: https://www.apple.com/itunes/video/

    ### Analysis

    Once you have watched the movie, you are to record a **podcast** or
    **video** as a group that does the following:

    - Provide a brief background about the context of movie.

    - If you examined a code of ethics:

        - Explain the ethical or moral engineering dilemma(s) presented in the film.

        - Identify the stakeholders in each situation.

        - Analyze the actions of people involved through the lens of your
          professional society's code of ethics.

    - Otherwise, if you explored the issue of diversity:

        - Describe what role gender and ethnicity played in the movie. What
          were the challenges or obstacles faced by the engineers or scientists?

        - Discuss the strategies and approaches the engineers or scientists
          utilized to overcome these challenges and whether or not they were
          successful.

        - Discuss the final message or theme of the movie.  What insight into
          the challenges of diversity in STEM did the movie provide?

    - Discuss if the movie was good or not.

    Your recording should be between **5** and **15** minutes in length.  It
    should not be totally scripted; instead it should follow a round-robin or
    panel style discussion of the required topics above.
      
    ### Submission

    Your project is due at **midnight, Friday, July 15**.  You should upload
    your **podcast** or **video** to a cloud hosting service such as
    [YouTube][], [Google Drive][], [Vimeo][], or [Soundcloud][].

    To submit your project, one group member should fill out the following
