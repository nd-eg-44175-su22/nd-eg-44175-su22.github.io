  **Everyone**:

  Welcome to [EG 44175 Ethical and Professional Issues in Engineering], which
  is a course where the goal is to get you to think about the ethical and moral
  issues surrounding engineering and technology, along with your
  responsibilities as a [Notre Dame] engineer.  Unlike most of your Engineering
  classes, there will be no programming, design work, experiments, or even
  math.  Rather the course will revolve around reading and writing and
  discussion; it will be more similar to what you find in Arts and Letters than
  in Engineering or Science.

  ## Course Overview

  As you can see from the [course schedule], we will be going through a variety
  of ethical and professional issues and topics related to engineering
  including:

  - **Responsibility**: Professional Engineering, Code of Ethics, Code of
    Conduct

  - **Disasters**: Engineering Disasters, Whistleblowing

  - **Regulation**: Corporate Conscience, Antitrust, Environment

  - **Intellectual Property**: Patents, Copyrights, Right to Repair

  - **Political Issues**: Surveillance and Privacy, Surveillance and Freedom of
    Speech, Immigration and Automation, and Artificial Intelligence and
    Cryptocurrency

  To enable robust class **discussions**, there is a **daily reading
  assignment** where you are expected to read articles, watch videos, or listen
  to podcasts, and then take a **quiz** that includes one or more reflection
  writing prompts (the first reading is below).

  To encourage creative expression and different modes of communication, you
  will also be expected to work on **two group projects**.  Each of these
  projects will require you to reflect on the issues and topics discussed in
  class and to produce a group artifact such as a **video** or **podcast**.
  Further explanation on these group projects will be provided in the future.

  At the end of the course, there is a **final exam** which will consist of
  questions from the daily reading quizzes along with some reflection writing
  prompts.
